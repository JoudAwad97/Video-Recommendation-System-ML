# Lambda requirements - optimized for cold start performance
# Only includes dependencies needed for inference, not training

# Core ML inference
# Pin EXACT versions to ensure compatibility and use pre-built wheels
# These versions are tested to work together on ARM64 Lambda
numpy==1.26.4
scipy==1.13.1
pandas==2.1.4
scikit-learn==1.4.2

# Ranking model inference
# Install catboost without matplotlib/graphviz (visualization deps not needed in Lambda)
# We use --no-deps in Dockerfile and install only the core dependencies
catboost==1.2.7

# Data serialization
pyarrow>=12.0.0,<18.0.0

# AWS SDK
boto3>=1.28.0

# Redis cache (optional)
redis>=4.5.0,<6.0.0

# Configuration
pyyaml>=6.0

# Note: TensorFlow is NOT included for Lambda due to size constraints
# The Two-Tower model embeddings should be pre-computed and stored
# For real-time embedding generation, use SageMaker endpoints
